# Reverse Engineering Cookbook

Reverse engineering is a process that examines an existing product to determine detailed information 
and specifications in order to learn how it was made and how it works. For mechanical assemblies, this typically 
involves disassembly and then analyzing, measuring and documenting the parts. Reverse engineering is not limited 
to mechanical components or assemblies. Electronic components and computer programs (software), as well as biological, 
chemical and organic matter can be reverse engineered as well.

The process of reverse engineering of software aims at restoring a higher-level representation (e.g. assembly code) 
of software in order to analyze its structure and behavior. Today, software is usually distributed in binary form 
which is, from an attackerâ€™s perspective, substantially harder to understand than source code.
However, various techniques can be applied for analyzing binary code.
